Milkpail SKU Training Software
==============================

My new cashiering job requires twitch-response command of PLU and SKU codes for all manners of bulk grains, produce, and other groceries.

I want to create a Python 2.7.6 implementation with PyGame that shows an image and name and expects the code to continue.  I would then like to build a better version of the program with Pyglet and Python 3.4 to concretize my understanding between versions and practice refactoring.  Eventually I would like to make a JavaScript implementation of this program so that users wouldn't have to download an executable and have better cross-platform functionality.

FUTURE FEATURES
---------------

Timing, attempt to analyze times in order to retest difficult or failed codes

Simple to edit database, for future or deprecated PLUs

A way to only test certain PLU's


TODO
----

Text file with all PLUs

Dict that reads .txt and populates dict in program

Keypad typing animation
